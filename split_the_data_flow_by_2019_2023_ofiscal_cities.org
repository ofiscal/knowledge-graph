#+title: Split the data flow by 2019 | 2023 \\ ofiscal / cities
* requirements
  That data flow should be a CL parameter.
  The source data should be similarly bifurcated in the folders,
  and correspond as closely as possible.
  Any differences between them can be handled in a separate Makefile
  that makes the new data look like the old data.
* TODO
** DONE Make a new branch, "parameterize-by-vintage-of-source-data".
** DONE Introduce a new command line argument "vintage" to the Makefile.
** TODO organize the data
*** DONE Push all source data from data/ to data/2019/.
*** Push all output data from output/ to output/2019/.
*** Make all paths to that data contingent on the vintage.
*** Don't yet code for the case where vintage != 2019.
