#+title: deploy tax.co.web over EC2
* DONE initial setup
** DONE package the docker images
*** where I put it
    ~/tax_co.docker.tar
*** how
    https://stackoverflow.com/a/28364045/916142
*** why: speed
    Uploading such a .tar file from my home machine to the server will be much faster than downloading it from DockerHub onto the server.
** DONE start an EC2 instance
*** the config I'm trying
**** AMI: Amazon Linux 2
**** Instance type: 16 GB RAM
**** configure: do nothing
     "hibernation" is an option, but it requires an HD big enough to store the RAM in addition to whatever I want in "colder" storage.
**** storage
     16 GB HD
       The Docker image iself is 7.1 GB.
       Eventually I'll want even more, but later.
**** Configure Security Group
     All of these accessible from anywhere
       (not "My IP", and not "Custom", whatever that is).
     SSH (default), which (I think) means* port 22
     HTTP (added), which (I think) means* port 80
     HTTPS (added), which (I think) means* port 443
** DONE install docker, emacs, git
   sudo yum install -y docker emacs git
*** first time I tried, all docker dependencies were already installed
   sudo yum install -y yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2
** DONE transfer from home machine
   scp takes a long time for big files.
*** ~/tax_co.docker.tar
    scp -i ~/code/aws/secret/2021-04-14.1.pem ~/tax_co.docker.tar ec2-user@18.231.152.118:~
    docker load -i tax_co.docker.tar
*** ~/of/webapp.zip
    scp -i ~/code/aws/secret/2021-04-14.1.pem ~/of/webapp.zip ec2-user@18.231.152.118:~
    unzip webapp.zip
*** ~/of/tax.co/web.zip
    scp -i ~/code/aws/secret/2021-04-14.1.pem ~/of/tax.co/master.zip ec2-user@18.231.152.118:~
    unzip master.zip
    mv master tax.co
** DONE configure Docker not to need sudo
   sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user
   then close ssh and ssh back in
** DONE set up Git in the new environment
 git config --global core.editor "emacs -nw"
   # -nw: use Emacs at the command line (not via the gui)
   # Maybe not necessary in a GUIless system.
 Copy /.ssh/id_rsa from my home system to the new system.
 Add my user name and email (Git will say how when I try to push).
** MAYBE DONE configure filepaths
*** Take notes here of what needs changing.
    webapp/commands.sh
      change jeff -> ec2-user
*** Eventually make those changes programmatic.
** DONE configure Apache
*** try adding a port number to my request
    Beware that the port number outside the container might map to a different one inside the container.
    Edit ports.conf, add it (eventually) to git@github.com:ofiscal/tax.co.web.git
* each time it starts
** DONE login
   ssh -i ~/code/aws/secret/2021-04-14.1.pem ec2-user@18.231.152.118
** DONE associate a domain name with the EC2 instance
   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-ec2-instance.html
*** get the IPv4 Public IP address for the EC2 instance
    18.231.152.118
*** in Route53
    Go to that domain.
    Choose Create Record.
** TODO start apache as root
   I can't serve to the internet unless I do that,
   which means I need to start the docker container as root:
     docker exec -it -u 0 webapp bash
** DONE visit this URL
   http://sim.jefbrown.net/myapp/run_make/write_time
     based on this
       http://localhost:8000/myapp/run_make/write_time
