#+title: modeling a drop in hours required for women to pension
* to Juan Miguel,
* our back-of-the-envelope steady-state calculation
** reduce yearly female pension contribs by 10/13
** increase yearly female pension payouts by (?)
   We'd like to know how many women currently end with between 1000 and 1300 hours of contributions.
* under- or over-estimating?
** TODO senses in which we are underestimating the cost of the mooted change
*** TODO mention : Contrary to our SS assumption, in reality the ratio of old to young is increasing.
** senses in which we are overestimating the cost of the mooted change
*** People who attain 1000 hours early will likely continue to work, and hence to contribute.
*** ? Not everyone will switch to the public regime.
    If they're rational, they will, and the government ought to be ready to pay for that.
* mysteries
** How to know who contributes how much?
** How to compute state transition probabilities?
