** TODO rules, for me to code using the GEIH
*** earning less than 2 min, under Ed's proposal, 13% of wages go to Colpensiones (public)
    need to know how much that is
*** by Ed, 13% of the rest goes to RAIS (private)
*** status quo: some percentage goes to either Colpensiones or RAIS, but can get the total, which should be around 38 (Colombian) billones COP
*** my estimates from the status quo are too calibrate how much to expland what I estiamte for Ed's proposal
*** threholds might be from 1.5 to 4 minima

** make public contracts more transparent
** the information avail now is good only if you know how to navigate it
** cruzar (merge) contract data with corruption data
   but we don't have corruption data
** aliados para crear el indice de corupción
   Transparencia and Veinte are the most likely to be useful.
*** Transparencia por Colombia
    They work on discovering corruption.
    Their data comes from the news.
    Their data is biased toward big corruption scandals.
*** Los Veinte
    Lawyers working on transparency.
    One of their interests is that some info that should be public,
    re. penal or civil processes, is not made public.
    That's information that judges most likely have.
    We might be able to use their data to know whether parties to any public contract were sued. Best case.
    Second best: They tell us the information doesn't exist.
** if we can't use external data to identify corruption, we'll just cluster the data
   or maybe not clustering but just look at how a contract's cost differs from what we predict.
** problems with writing a citizens' guide
   Transparencia para Colombia already did that.
   Lots of bulletins, maps, things about SECOP, and how they scrape the news.

* TODO testing whether email == quien@donde.net is failing
** how to test
   I already set a trace in requests.main.
   Now run it twice, first adding to temp queue,
   then trying to advance queue.
** thoughts
  My gmail tried to send another such email.
  The only place in the code it could be triggered from is requests.main.
  Maybe req["user email"] is not a string?
* TODO new sim, but for after the "income-tax" picture
** irrelevant to the code: more declarantes
   alternatives?
*** everyone declares
*** if you earn more than 2e6 CGG, you have to declare taxes
    CGG = labor income - SS - 2e6 - 1e6 * #dependents
** negative CGG => reimbursed
** 1 million per child, can have more than 1
** make a slightly different baseline: include dependents in the 40%, but only 25% if none
   for the baseline only
** 20% income tax for negative CGG
** assign fractional dependents -- divide # dependents by # of taxpayers
** if no earners, head of household gets (- 2e6 - 1e6 * #deps)
* TODO document units of observation and quantiles somewhere
  Recall that the meaning of the quantiles in nonzero-laborers is different. In each data set the quantiles are over the unit in the name of that data set -- so earners quantiles are computed over all earners (including the unemployed), not households; household quantiles are computed over households; and nonzero_laborers quantiles are computed over earners with nonzero labor income. But additionally, whereas the other two data sets have their quantiles computed with respect to total income, the nonzero-laborers quantiles are computed only with regard to labor income.
