#+title: cities repo : update for 2023
* TODO
** Makefile problems
*** Why is sample_tables running?
*** Why are some paths being read as files at /?
    They should be deeper in the tree.
** Split the data flow into 2019 and 2023
   That data flow should be a CL parameter.
   The source data should be similarly bifurcated in the folders,
   and correspond as closely as possible.
   Any differences between them can be handled in a separate Makefile
   that makes the new data look like the old data.
** Update data/sisfut/csv.
   That's what's used in budget_0_*.py
*** use new wide format for sisfut data
** Update data/regalias/*.csv
   That's 2 data sets, `muni` and `dept`.
** Determine whether output/keys/* need to change.
** Verify that the categories still mean the same thing.
   The dictionary I wrote is here:
   ~/of/cities/Code/build/classify_budget_codes.py
** add Indice de Desempe√±o Fiscal to cities
   available from SISFUT
   The new methodology might not be available for recent years.
