#+title: tax hike proposal, Colombian Senate, 2020
* the law
** part 1: wealth tax change
I'm asking Daniel if it's measured in pesos (surely it is) or UVT.
The brackets have changed but so too have the rates risen a lot,
so we can put a minimum on the increase in revenue.
** part 2: personal dividend income tax change
** part 3: personal income tax change
Section 3, the first table.
(The second one in theory should have no effect.)
** part 4: change in inheritance tax
* TODO modifying tax.co for the proposal
** PTIFALLS
*** everything is specified in UVTs
** inheritance income: incorporate into relevant totals
** inheritance income: add taxes for it
ape the dividend tax
** replace python.regime.r2018.non_dividend_income_tax
** DONE ask Lorenzo: answers are all yes
*** the other taxes continue to apply, omitting inheritance, right?
*** if the kinds of income taxed are the same
** replace the dividend portion of python.regime.r2018.income_taxes
* the current wealth brackets

* does DIAN say how much revenue they took in from each wealth bracket in the wealth tax?
Daniel's not sure this is it, but
"the best data set I found was Estad√≠sticas de recaudo mensual" (attached to the email).
