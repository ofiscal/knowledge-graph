** TODO We have employment sector, right?
   Yes. "CIIU"
** subsidize healthy prepared food
   for gender equity
** hotels employ more women
* TODO review [[id:dc968fea-dd45-4734-b375-9e60b87005c6][tax.co]]: in org-roam, and TODO notes in code
* TODO mtg: DIAN-extending the model, <2022-08-30 Tue>
** TODO the regression uses *(natural) log of yearly* income
   so to apply them to the microsimulation,
   first divide by 12, then take the log,
   then apply the coefficients,
   then exponentiate (base e).
** notes
*** imagine ganancias oc taxed at 10%
    since can't tell in DIAN data
*** maybe ge erate synthetic households
    based on the ENPH data, from the DIAN data
*** need income individuals for income taxes
*** use a regression to predict DIAN quantile given an ENPH observation
    income, no laboral
    income, labor
    income, capital
    income, ganancias ocasionales (total)
    income, pension
    income, dividend
** questions
*** DONE How do unequal income earners split wealth on their tax declarations?
    like I thought -- hard.
    Can change the divison each year, arbitrarily.
*** what's the PILA?
    SS contrib data
* TODO [[id:448b41e2-e1b1-4659-beaa-e9661a03a048][document the microsimulation]]
* TODO testing whether email == quien@donde.net is failing
** how to test
   I already set a trace in requests.main.
   Now run it twice, first adding to temp queue,
   then trying to advance queue.
** thoughts
  My gmail tried to send another such email.
  The only place in the code it could be triggered from is requests.main.
  Maybe req["user email"] is not a string?
* TODO new sim, but for after the "income-tax" picture
** irrelevant to the code: more declarantes
   alternatives?
*** everyone declares
*** if you earn more than 2e6 CGG, you have to declare taxes
    CGG = labor income - SS - 2e6 - 1e6 * #dependents
** negative CGG => reimbursed
** 1 million per child, can have more than 1
** make a slightly different baseline: include dependents in the 40%, but only 25% if none
   for the baseline only
** 20% income tax for negative CGG
** assign fractional dependents -- divide # dependents by # of taxpayers
** if no earners, head of household gets (- 2e6 - 1e6 * #deps)
* TODO document units of observation and quantiles somewhere
  Recall that the meaning of the quantiles in nonzero-laborers is different. In each data set the quantiles are over the unit in the name of that data set -- so earners quantiles are computed over all earners (including the unemployed), not households; household quantiles are computed over households; and nonzero_laborers quantiles are computed over earners with nonzero labor income. But additionally, whereas the other two data sets have their quantiles computed with respect to total income, the nonzero-laborers quantiles are computed only with regard to labor income.
