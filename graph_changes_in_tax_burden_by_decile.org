#+title: graph changes in tax burden by decile in tax.co.web
[[id:106ca7be-c9de-42c6-89aa-db93c5202304][This]] makes that hard.
* what to draw
  The horizontal axis will be income deciles or percentiles.
  The vertical one needs to be the sum of all taxes.
    The income column is just "income".
    VAT paid
      is the VAT column
    tax, income
      is the major one
    All of these might or might not be part of "tax, income"
      tax, income, gmf
      cesantias
      tax, ss, cajas de compensacion
      tax, ss, parafiscales
      tax, ss, solidaridad
      tax, ss, salud, employer
      tax, ss, salud
    Some that we're ignoring?
      tax, predial
      whatever else is similar to that
