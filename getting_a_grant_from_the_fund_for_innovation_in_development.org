*** their question
    Brief description of the project/innovation or solution
    Please provide a short description of the project and your innovation or solution in no more than two sentences.
*** our answer
    Our system will automatically detect anomalous public contracts and report them to the public, empowering voters and providing accountability for lawmakers. We will also engage in communication efforts -- with the media, with lawmakers, various forms of publication, and colloquia -- to make the system's findings known.
** DONE "Development Challenge"
*** their question
    What is the problem that you are targeting and how does it affect the lives of people living in poverty and/or marginalized populations? How would solving this problem improve people's lives? How many people does this issue impact both in the country/countries you are working in and globally? Please explain who, specifically, is impacted by the problem (e.g., different genders, age groups, income levels, marginalized populations, etc.).
*** our answer
Public contract spending in Colombia is opaque. This results in official impunity, the misuse and misappropriation of funds, and voter apathy – the last of which entrenches poor governance.

On paper, Colombia provides a wealth of services to every population, particularly its most vulnerable – healthcare (which is socialized), education, public housing, sanitation, energy, infrastructure, security, justice, and countless others. In practice, however, much of this spending is wasted or stolen. Those with the means spend to secure better services from the private sector. Those without suffer red tape and long queues for shoddy services. Ambulances can take hours to arrive. Police often simply don't. Ordinary citizens pay the price in time, money, health, security, justice and economic growth. Colombians would have more of all of those things, if government funds were better spent.

Greater transparency would result not just in better spending. It would also, by making officials accountable for their actions, improve democratic outcomes, specifically citizen participation and candidate quality. The government would not only better fulfill its existing promises, but make better ones in the future.

These issues affect, and hence our solution would help, every one of Colombia's 50 million citizens. It would particularly help those citizens who are unable to secure private alternatives to government-provided services -- a group that constitutes more than 90% of the population.

*** their question
    Please provide a brief description of your innovation or solution and how it addresses the development challenge. In this description, please summarize why your approach is innovative: why does your innovation have potential to address the development challenge more easily, at lower cost, faster, or more feasibly at scale than the status quo or alternative solutions? Please indicate the alternative solutions that already exist and specifically how your innovation differs. What are the advantages of your innovation compared to existing solutions to address the development challenge? Please address whether your innovation has been piloted and what you have learned from piloting. In your response, please discuss results you have achieved to date, including the number of people your innovation or solution currently serves and any evidence of demand for your innovation or that the innovation fills an identifiable need.
*** our answer
The information needed to monitor public contracts in Colombia is, technically, available to everybody. Colombia publishes data on public contracts in a number of online databases. The amount of data, while incomplete, is extremely large, and with some difficulty it can be searched. If a citizen suspected a specific contract of being mismanaged, they could typically find a great deal of information regarding it from these systems. But systematically traversing the data as it is updated to look for anomalies would require an impossible amount of time, were a human to do it.

A computer could do it, though, and that is our plan. We have already written code that can extract data from some of the online contract databases. The software that remains to be written is a supervised learning algorithm to automatically detect anomalous contracts, and an automatic system for publication of anomalous results. We have two years of experience creating online systems -- in particular, our online tax microsimulation: http://www.ofiscal-puj.org/microsim/run_make/manual_ingest.

We have five years of experience communicating with lawmakers, the media, and civil society groups -- as abundantly evidenced by our Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf75rVz--QES-Xs83tdrl5A/videos We will rely on that experience as we pilot local dissemination efforts -- colloquia in small communities, explaining what the software has discovered about contracts in those communities, and how ordinary citizens can use it to monitor such activity.

This project is not merely innovative, but unique -- it solves a problem nobody has tackled before. The only existing "solution" is to hope that individuals sampling droplets from the ocean of online data on public contracts will somehow be able to provide the accountability that a well-functioning democracy requires. Instead of that -- instead of needing an absurd amount of human labor -- our system will require 24 months of programming and research from a small team.

Once the software is written, it will be able to run indefinitely on a single server, monitoring all public information on contracts available in Colombia, with occasional maintenance from a single programmer-economist. We will continue to engage in publicity efforts, but those will be cheap relative to the up-front cost of developing the system.

Our prior investigations of public contract databases revealed that the funds allocated by the Fondo de Mitigación de Emergencia (FOME) for the Covid emergency were being directed by a private agency under no obligation to make its spending public. The attention we brought to this issue forced the government to move those funds to the ministry of health, which as part of the government is so obligated to make its contracts public. The resulting transparency permitted citizen oversight of spending, resulting in more efficient spending, as well as savings, we believe, of thousands of millions of pesos. And those results came merely from monitoring a single database, manually; our automated system will have a much greater scale.
** DONE "Gender Equality"
   :PROPERTIES:

*** their question
    How have you considered gender equality in the design of your innovation? How can its implementation contribute to reducing gender inequalities? Note that additional information on gender is also expected in response to the questions below, including theory of change, expected impact, project team and prospects for scaling up.
*** our answer
Our project will improve gender equality in three ways.

(1) Adequate provision of government services is especially important to the most vulnerable populations. To the extent -- which is substantial -- that women and female-led households have, on average, fewer resources than men and male-led households, our work will further gender equality.

(2) The databases of public contracts in Colombia include a flag for projects intended to benefit women specifically. Whenever our work detects suspicious information in such contracts, it will permit citizen oversight of a sort that can benefit the women for whom the spending was intended.

(3) Furthermore, where it is possible, we will monitor for gender parity in the contracts themselves. This will be possible when a contract involves enough sub-contracts that the fractions going to men and women can be considered statistically meaningful evidence of unequal gender treatment.
** DONE theory of change
*** their question
    The “Theory of Change” describes a strategy or blueprint for achieving a desired long-term goal. The theory of change identifies the prerequisites, pathways, and interventions needed to achieve that goal. A theory of change should include an identification of needs, inputs, outputs, intermediate outcomes, and final outcomes. It allows you to build a clear narrative and highlight the causal chain of events and assumptions that explain your innovation and its impact on people. Please describe the theory of change behind your innovation (how the solution will lead to the desired results). Please specify the assumptions on which it is based, and your level of confidence around these assumptions. Please also explain the parts of the theory of change for which you already have evidence, and the parts for which evidence remains to be established. Further, please specify how a perspective of gender is integrated within your theory of change.Please state the intended impact of your innovation as a result of the activities proposed in this application, clearly stating the primary result you wish to achieve as well as any additional outcomes expected (e.g., impacts on gender, health outcomes, household income change, etc.). Note that you can also illustrate your Theory of Change with the help of a diagram by uploading an image of it (JPEG or PNG format) in Question 6.2 (highly recommended). If you upload a diagram in Question 5.2, please also respond to Question 5.1 with a narrative explanation of the diagram provided.

The work required consists of the following stages:
(*) Learn to parse each of the remaining databases. (We can already parse some of them.)
(*) Label a set of training data, identifying suspicious- and ordinary-looking contracts.
(*) Experiment with supervised learning architectures. Select one.
(*) Experiment with unsupervised learning algorithms. Select one.
(*) Train both algorithms and integrate them.
(*) Code a process to scrape the databases for updates.
(*) Code a process to regularly publish suspicious contracts to one of our websites, so that they are available to any internet user.
(*) Share the system's results with lawmakers and the media.
(*) Share the results in live colloquia, inviting academics, journalists and congresspeople.

The project relies on the following assumptions, each of which we present together with the probability we assign it:
(*) 95%: The online DBs will continue to exist.
(*) 95%: The online DBs will continue to be parseable.
(*) 99%: We will continue to be permitted to publish the data and host our colloquia.
(*) 99%: Our work will continue to attract attention, fuel debate, and enable citizen oversight.
(*) 95%: Citizen oversight will continue to result in changes in government policy.
(*) 80%: The project will take two years.

The potential benefits of this program are literally too many to count, but three of the most salient are these:
(*) Better provision of healthcare. This will benefit almost everybody, but it will disproportionately benefit the poorest, families with children, and caretakers (which are disproportionately women).
(*) Better infrastructure, which has the direct effects of economic growth, higher wages, better employment, and better sanitation (hence public health).
(*) Better education. This benefits not just the young, but also anyone who takes care of them (which again in Colombia is disproportionately women), and anyone who shares a household and hence resources with children.
(*) Greater public safety. This, like infrastructure, enables people to spend more time at work, studying, or engaging in leisure. These benefits accrue disproportionately to the vulnerable populations, since wealthier ones have already bought a greater measure of safety from the private sector.

*** their question
    Stage 1 funding requires monitoring and evaluation and data collection plans during the grant period to test the key assumptions of the theory of change. FID’s goal with Stage 1 pilot testing is to illustrate the potential economic and social outcomes and actual costs of implementing the solution in a real world setting. Please list the relevant metrics or indicators you will use to track your innovation’s performance, and how you will collect and monitor this data.
*** our answer
Since contracts include location data, we can run controlled experiments to determine the effectiveness of the program, by randomly dividing regions into treatment and control groups, and publishing our system's results for the treatment group while withholding it for the control group. After running the intervention for a period long enough to expect some impact -- at least half a year -- the change in contract problematicity in the control and treatment groups will permit statistical testing to determine whether the intervention makes a meaningful difference.

We will use supervised and unsupervised learning to develop our measure of problematicity in government contracts. While this measure will not be the same as corruption or mismanagement, they will be correlated.
** DONE Activities to be supported
*** their question
**** describe
**** provide a tentative schedule
**** explain how each investigates
     Please describe how these activities will help you to determine the innovation’s technical or operational viability in a real-world setting.
**** amounts and justifications
     Please indicate approximate amounts (in euros) to be spent on each activity and provide a brief justification for the total amounts to be spent.
**** indicate any amount of co-funding
*** our response
We have as yet received no co-financing for the project.

The activities in our budget are the following:

(1)  (9,700.00 €) Study, parse and unify the online databases. This stage will be brief but fundamental: the other stages all rely on it.

Stages (2), (3) and (4) are concurrent.

(2) (87,000.00 €) Descriptive statistics, numerical analysis. In this stage we build our own understanding of the data.

(3) (47,650.00 €) Build prediction models. These models will be used to identify suspicious contract activity.

(4) (18,500.00 €) Build scraping and publishing software. The scraping software will automatically update our meta-database as the databases that it was generated from are themselves updated. The publishing software will update our online analyses, including any suspicious activity the algorithm identifies.

(5) (18,500.00 €) Write and publish reports. These will explain how to use the databases provided by the government and our own meta-database, and will detail our research findings from stages (2) and (3).

(6) (18,500.00 €) Public events and exposure efforts. This stage consists of outreach to news media, the government and the citizenry at large. The outreach will use all available media: online, via traditional broadcast media, in small in-person meetings, and in seminars and colloquia.
** Pathway to Scale
As soon as the software is written and running, it will already be at full-scale: monitoring all contracts in the public contract databases. Colombia's population is about 50 million people, and it will make the data available to everyone (indeed, even to people outside the country -- it's just a website, after all). Of course not all 50 million people will be reading it, but the resulting improvements in visibility, accountability, and voter information will serve everyone equally.

The major expense is building the software. Once it is running it will only require occasional maintenance from a single developer, plus the cost of running the server itself, which might be two hundred dollars a month.
** Cost-effectiveness of the innovation
*** their question
    FID is interested in understanding why your solution has the potential to have a greater impact per euro than alternative means of addressing the same development challenge, including the status quo. Briefly present the existing solutions to address the development challenge in your location or in other regions. To the best of your ability, please provide your best estimate of the current cost of the innovation per beneficiary served or unit treated (including any co-funding, but not including evaluation and data collection costs). Please include both fixed and variable costs. Please indicate how you plan to provide an initial measure of cost-effectiveness in terms of cost per development outcome in Stage 1. How do you expect these costs to change as your innovation scales? Note: FID understands that precise estimates can be difficult to calculate. Please include explanations for your working assumptions and supporting calculations to demonstrate how you reached your estimates.
** Applicant Organization (who we are)
*** their question
    Please provide an overview of the lead implementing organization and include relevant past experience implementing similar activities. Describe your organization’s area of expertise and within the targeted context and explain both why it is uniquely positioned and has the capacity to implement the proposed activities.
** Risks (to launch, to sustain and to scale) and mitigation plans
   local context(s)
   technical risks
   institutional and regulatory risks
   market risks
   environmental and social risks
   climate risks
** Partner Organizations
*** our answer
    There are none so far.
** BLOCKED (asked Oliver, Daniel, Angelica and Alejandro): citations?
** BLOCKED (asking Angelica): maintenance cost
   Daniel and I guess a month of one programmer-economist's labor per year.
   I'm asking Angelica what that costs.
*** resource usage
    The assets this project requires are minimal: The labor of [[HOW MANY PEOPLE, OF WHAT KIND?]] and one server running 24/7.
