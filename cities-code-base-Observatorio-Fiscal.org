#+title: cities (code base, Observatorio Fiscal)
* refs
  https://github.com/ofiscal/cities
  https://github.com/ofiscal/cities-output
* TODO update for 2023
** Update data/sisfut/csv.
   That's what's used in budget_0_*.py
*** use new wide format for sisfut data
** Update data/regalias/*.csv
   That's 2 data sets, `muni` and `dept`.
** Determine whether output/keys/* need to change.
** Verify that the categories still mean the same thing.
   The dictionary I wrote is here:
   ~/of/cities/Code/build/classify_budget_codes.py
** restore integration tests
   Code/integ_tests/
** add Indice de Desempe√±o Fiscal to cities
   available from SISFUT
   The new methodology might not be available for recent years.
** DONE
*** [[id:30310432-6fe1-48ce-8bba-a5c77daf8b74][Split the data flow by 2019 | 2023 \\ ofiscal / cities]]
*** Makefile problems
**** Why is sample_tables running?
**** Why are some paths being read as files at /?
     They should be deeper in the tree.
