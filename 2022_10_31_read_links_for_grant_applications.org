** made a first pass
*** Global Innovation Fund
    https://www.globalinnovation.fund/apply/
**** We're a good fit for almost everything they want.
     https://www.globalinnovation.fund/apply/about/what-we-fund/
*** Fund for Innovation in Development
    https://fundinnovation.dev/en/application-form-step-0/
**** their goals
     https://fundinnovation.dev/en/
***** They want to reduce poverty.
***** They want "evidence of clear, measurable outcomes", which seems hard.
***** They want cost effectiveness. We are certainly cheap.
      Making research scales in a way that
      making drugs or any physical product doesn't.
***** They want scalability. We're already in a sense at scale.
*** Fundaci√≥n S'AIDDES
    http://www.saiddes.org/subventions-aux-ong_110.html
    I don't speak French.
*** Inter American Foundation
    https://www.iaf.gov/es/solicite-fondos/
**** eligibility looks shaky
     https://www.iaf.gov/apply-for-grant/#eligibility
     "We do NOT fund proposals submitted or directed by ... Privately-held companies"
     "we rarely fund projects submitted by universities. It often takes us longer than a school year to review proposals and release the funds, so student groups seeking funds for their projects will not receive them in time."
*** BLOCKED (bad docs) UN Trust Fund for Human Security (UNTFHS)
**** Buried in bureaucratic crap. No idea what they want.
     [[/home/jeff/of/papers/UNTFHS-Guidelines.9th-Edition_2020.pdf]]
     https://www.un.org/humansecurity/trustfund/faqs-2-2/
*** BLOCKED (bad site) The Gef Small Grants Programme
    https://sgp.undp.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=94:how-to-apply&catid=45:aboutus&Itemid=160#.VkNeYV7Vo_8
**** Small grants -- 25K to 50K USD.
**** broken webpage
***** email I sent them about it
      https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#sent/KtbxLrjNZJWdQcVDHdMqVlxNTPZQRkQgsq
***** problem: the only area of work available is biodiversity
     https://sgp.undp.org/areas-of-work-151/biodiversity-170.html
*** CIVICUS
    https://www.civicus.org/index.php/what-we-do/defend/crisis-response-fund
**** Does not look well suited to us.
     It's about crises of civic freedom.
** haven't
*** The OPEC Fund
**** refs
***** website
      https://opecfund.org/what-we-offer/grants/grant-application
***** grant guidelines (pdf)
      [[/home/jeff/of/papers/OPEC-fund-grant-guidelines.pdf]]
**** They want measurability and alignment.
     Alignment of our goals with theirs.
**** shaky -- need a "government commitment"?
***** the worrisome passage
      For all types of grants, and with the exception of emergency aid grants and grants in support of projects sponsored by other development finance institutions or UN agencies, proposed activities and projects may be undertaken only where there is a solid commitment from the government to the project concerned.
***** but maybe that's okay because
      we're a project sponsored by another development finance institution (OSF)
