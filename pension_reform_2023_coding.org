** Is the income I see in the MPMD before or after pension contributions?
** What if someone's "formal labor income" is below the minimum?
   Should I imagine they contribute to the pension anyway?
   Should I recode it at 0?
   Angelica talked about special cases where
   formal income can be less than the minimum wage.
* TODO choosing income variables in the [[id:85593eb1-0594-4334-a936-6abb421c675f][MPMD]]
** candidates
*** RESUME in documentation if needed
    After V480 (see below)
   -- but hopefully not;
   it was Daniel's idea nad looks good to me.
*** TODO Personas V479 and V480: primary and secondary activity income
**** filtered by V391 and V440: what those activities are
*** V362: income before rent
    Ingreso total de la unidad de
gasto antes de imputaci√≥n de
arriendo a propietarios y
usufructuarios
*** V452: work income ("desocupados"?)
*** V454: same as V452?
* other important variables
** weight
   If this is at the household level, will also need household IDs,
   and a merge.
* pseudocode
** In person data, build "formal labor income".
** Make the threshold at which income goes to the private system a CL arg.
** Compute "income below private pension threshold".
   = min ( formal labor income
         , threshold )
** Compute "income above private pension threshold".
   = formal labor income - income below private pension threshold
** Compute "public pension contribution".
   I *believe* that's this:
   = 0.16 * income below private pension threshold".
