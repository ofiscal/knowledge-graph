This repository begins as a transfer of the org/ folder from git@github.com:ofiscal/tax.co.git. It contains notes that have proved useful for building the Observatorio Fiscal tax micorosimulation, particularly regarding the Colombian tax code and the ENPH dataset from DANE.

These notes form a knowledge graph. They link to each other. The meaning of the links should be apparent upon ordinary inspection, but they are much easier to follow and create using [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and [org-roam](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/).

Not all of this information is what Andy Matuschak would call [evergreen](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes). Much of it is lists of things to do, or open questions.
